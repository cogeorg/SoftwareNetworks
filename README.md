This is the repository for "Software Networks" by Co-Pierre Georg and Angelo Mele. It roughly follows the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">gitflow</a> workflow and uses several branches that correspond to stable states of the development and, eventually, to different versions of the paper. The repository includes the following branches:
- main: The main development branch where things are in motion and might break.
- v0.1: A first stable branch corresponding to a full test run of highly stylized sample data.
